sshrdp

A wrapper script used for tunneling freerdp connections over RDP with NLA enabled

To use:
1. Put the sshrdp script somewhere along your path.
2. Create a ~/.sshrdp/bouncehost file which contains the host you'd like to use for ssh tunnelling on the first line
3. Run sshrdp <host> [<additional freerdp options>]

The script assumes:
* That your username matches your linux user
* That rdp NLA keys are stored in ~/.freerdp/known_hosts
* That you are using ssh keys and that your key is already added to ssh-agent
* That you are using active directory, and an appropriate string for this is 'ad'

If any of this isn't true, edit the variables at the top of the script, or override the freerdp options on the command line
